# Business Data Analysis with Python

## About The Project
**This project is centered on reviewing and analyzing businesses. It showcases a multiplicity of different data analysis 
methods and techniques learned whilst undertaking my course, 'Data Analysis with Python', offered online by the University of 
Pennsylvania. Further, it utilizes a variety of popular Python libraries for data analysis such as pandas and matplotlib.**

<br>

**The project covers a range of core data analysis skills, including:** <br>
&emsp; 1) Reading and inspecting Excel files <br>
&emsp; 2) Merging and updating data <br>
&emsp; 3) Querying data <br>
&emsp; 4) Grouping, summarizing, and statistically analyzing data <br>
&emsp; 5) Data visualization <br>
&emsp; 6) Writing and/or updating Excel files <br>

<br>

I uploaded an Excel file, 'yelp.xlsx.', with all the data to be analyzed, and, as usual, I included uploaded two versions of the project, the first is a 
Python script with all the raw code, the second is Jupyter notebook version which breaks down the code from the Python script into separate sections
and cells, each cell includes a single block of code, which performs a specific analytic task, and its resulting output, rendered and ready for viewing. 
The Jupyter version is also slightly modified to utilize Jupyter's user-friendly environment for better rendering of the input and output. 
<br>
<br>

## Database
**The data being analyzed are contained in the file 'yelp.xlsx', which consists of data pertaining to a variety of local businesses, 
collected and published by yelp.com, a popular website for publishing crowd-sourced reviews about businesses.** 
<br>

**The file is comprised of three sheets (with the following coloumns):** <br>
 * **yelp_data:** *'name', 'category_0', 'category_1', 'take_out', 'review_count', 'stars', 'city_id', 'state_id'* <br>
 * **cities:** *'id', 'city'* <br>
 * **states:** *'id', 'state'* <br>
<br>
<br>

## Aim
**The aim of this project is to demonstrate my ability to work with Excel files and datasets, uncovering the general trends in the data and/or querying 
the data to extract certain key information or even a single piece of information (for instance, surveying the data in order to recommend a fast food 
restaurant with a 4-star rating or above in a nearby area).**

## Quick Access 
**You can quickly access the project from either of the links below. Both links will direct you to the Jupyter notebook version with all the code and corresponding 
output rendered and ready for viewing. The notebook is divided and organized into different sections with different cells, each cell captures a block of code as input and its corresponding result as output. The first link enables you to view the code and resulting output but without interacting with it. The second link on the other hand renders the code executable, which thereby allows you to both view the project and interact with the code, in case you preferred to reproduce the results yourself.**
